## Guide
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1nZVczqUd-kAmkYFAAgCpxXkeR0wn_2Pz?usp=sharing to access the solution
2. Run each code segment (shift + enter) starting from the top. This ensures that the necessary libraries are imported, and the model gets configured.
3. After the code segments have been run, the very bottom includes an interactive prediction system. Feel free to play with different measurements to receive a tumor prediction.
